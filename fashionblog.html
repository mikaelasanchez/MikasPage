        <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

            If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.
            But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, plan out which shows are most important to you and
            make a schedule and this is a biggie: <em>SET A BUDGET</em>.
            If you’re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers
            you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!
        </p>

        <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

             alt="Fashionable man wearing hat">
        <p>
            Always be true to your own sense of style,
            if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and
            taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day.
            Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long,
            so be prepared.
